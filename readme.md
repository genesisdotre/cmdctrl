### Manage all your sites from a single script
![Problem](http://i.imgur.com/ibHj2Ya.png)

### What it does
1. Load single JS file (TODO: remove Zepto so it doesn't weight 40KB)
2. Load CSS asynchronously
3. Create DIV markup
4. Execute .JS from appended file (from point 1)
5. Profit!

### Hosting on Github Pages
It's their core business to host files.
I believe they are here to stay.
